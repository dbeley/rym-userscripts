# rym-userscripts

Some userscripts for RateYourMusic.

![preview](docs/userscript_buttons.png)

- `song-charts.user.js`: add buttons to download song charts as CSV or plain text

- `album-charts.user.js`: add buttons to download album charts as CSV or plain text

You can configure RYM charts to display up to 100 elements at once in the chart settings.

Also in order to load all the images you will have to scroll to the bottom of the page.
